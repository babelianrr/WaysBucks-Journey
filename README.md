# WaysBucks
The initial version of WaysBucks by babelianrr.
I've fixed some codes to improve this project, thought there's still some bugs around.

## Getting started
- Clone the repository to your machine
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies
- Import `waysbucks.sql` to phpMyAdmin
- Use command `npm run dev` to run the app

### What users can do:
- Registering and logging in
- Creating transactions
- Checking profile (bug found on 0v.2-beta, can't access profile page)

### What admins can do:
- Checking and managing transactions
- Adding & removing products
- (new on v0.2-beta) Updating products

### Known bugs
- When switching language then navigating to other page, language selection changes into ENglish, thought the language still the same (to switch back to English just click the rendered language then click English again).
